This rails project framework is based of of Hartl's "Rails Tutorial," specifically the sample_app.  It includes some but not all of the excercises recommended.
Use this webapp to give you a simple cms platform that contains the necessary elements of most websites.  

I assume you already have setup Ruby, Rails, Git and Github.  

Once you clone this repo to your desired directory, change the directory name from "Framework" to the name of your app. Next, cd into the newly renamed directory and type
"bundle install".  Finally, you can replace the following instances of the term "Framework" with your own app's name by running the rename rake task.  If you want to name your
app "NewApp", you would type this: rake rename:to[NewApp].

	app/views/pages/home.html.erb.rb:1
	app/helpers/application_helper.rb:4
	rakefile:7
	congig/application.rb:18
	config.ru: 4
	config/database.yml: 15, 31, 42
	config/environments/development.rb:1
	config/environments/test.rb:1
	config/environments/production.rb:1
	config/environment.rb:5
	config/initializers/secret_token.rb:7
	config/initializers/session_store.rb:3 (x2) and 8
	config/routes:1
	spec/controllers/pages_controller_spec.rb:7, 16

Also, be sure to add your logo to assets/images since the current default logo is the Rails icon.  You'll also have to update app/helpers/application_helper.rb and
the corresponding test, located in update spec/controllers/pages_controller_spec with the logo's name and location. 

Happy developing!
